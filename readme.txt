Snap Tales - Instagram Style Stories, Integrated with BuddyPress and PeepSo. You can set up Post and Product stories manually or via WP-Admin.

== Description ==

### Snap Tales - Instagram Style Stories

Spice up your WordPress site and bring Instagram stories with Snap Tales. In addition to being able to manually create stories yourself, you can also mark Posts and Products as stories and have Instagram-style stories listed through categories.

Snap Tales also has a user stories feature, so your users can independently create their own stories and view other users' stories on your WordPress site.

In addition to the general WordPress user infrastructure, there is also integration with BuddyPress and PeepSo. This way, instead of seeing all users' stories, all users can only see the stories of their BuddyPress friends or users they follow on PeepSo.

**Best features:**

With the short code, you can easily use it anywhere. Users can create stories, and just like on Instagram, the stories they have already seen will be marked! You can also set it up so that BuddyPress friends or people they follow on PeepSo can see their stories.

**Maximum mobile compatibility:**

Snap Tales is designed to be fully compatible with mobile devices. You can easily swipe to change stories, and you can also use the stories on your mobile device without any problems.
